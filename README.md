# Credit Risk Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Credit Risk Model** to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The model helps financial institutions assess risk and make informed lending decisions. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **SQL** (for data extraction and preprocessing)
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for visualizations)

## 🔍 Data Description
The dataset contains loan application details with features such as:
- **Applicant Information**: Age, Employment Type, Income
- **Loan Details**: Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate
- **Credit History**: Previous Defaults, Credit Score
- **Target Variable**: `Default` (1 - Default, 0 - No Default)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values and outliers
- Analyzed correlations between features
- Visualized credit risk distribution

## 🚀 Model Development
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and categorical encoding
   - Feature scaling (if required)
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features like **Debt-to-Income Ratio**
   - Selected important features using feature importance scores
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained multiple models and selected the best-performing one
   - Evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC, and F1-score**
   
## 📈 Results & Insights
- The best-performing model was **[Model Name]** with an accuracy of **[XX]%**
- Feature importance analysis showed **[Key Features]** had the highest impact on risk prediction

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Tune hyperparameters for better performance
- Implement a **real-time credit risk API**
- Deploy the model for practical use
