Hi I am Lebogang ðŸŒŸ
Data Scientist | Aspiring AI and ML engineer. 
I am a passionate data and detail-oriented Mathematics and Statistics graduate with an Honours degree in Statistics. My academic foundation, combined with my technical expertise in data science, equips me to transform complex data into actionable insights that drive decision-making and innovation.

I possess strong technical skills in SQL, Python, Power BI, and Machine Learning, which I have applied to solve real-world problems and deliver data-driven solutions. My experience spans data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization, enabling me to communicate insights effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong interpersonal skills to the table. I have a proven track record in team leadership, project management, and communication, which allow me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and lead projects to successful completion. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can leverage both my analytical mindset and my ability to connect with people.

I am eager to continue growing in the field of data science and statistics, contributing to impactful projects, and making a meaningful difference through data.
